- **[Traffic Volume Prediction with PyTorch](https://github.com/Oussamabouriga/Traffic-Volume-Prediction.git)**  
  Developed an LSTM model to predict traffic volume using meteorological, temporal, and historical data, with advanced preprocessing and custom evaluation metrics for accuracy.  
  *Technologies*: Python, PyTorch, Data Preprocessing  
  *UI/UX & Animation*: Created a **data visualization dashboard** with **scroll-triggered animations** to unveil charts and predictions as users scroll, using a **staggered fade-in effect** for data points. Added **hover animations** with a **scale-up effect** to highlight specific predictions, and a **real-time line graph animation** that draws itself as data loads, enhancing user engagement and clarity.

- **[Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays](https://github.com/Oussamabouriga/classify-X-ray-images-for-PNEUMONIA.git)**  
  Leveraged transfer learning with ResNet-18 to detect pneumonia from chest X-rays, achieving high accuracy and F1 scores for binary classification (NORMAL/PNEUMONIA).  
  *Technologies*: Python, PyTorch, ResNet-18, Deep Learning  
  *UI/UX & Animation*: Designed a **diagnostic interface** with a **breathing animation** on the loading screen to mimic a calming effect during processing. Results are revealed with a **fade-in and scale animation**, while affected areas in the X-ray are highlighted with a **glowing outline animation**, guiding the user‚Äôs focus. Added a **tooltip animation** on hover to display confidence scores, improving diagnostic transparency.

- **[SoulLift ‚Äì Mental Well-Being App](#)**  
  A mental health app featuring AI-powered chatbots, motivational quotes, and stress management tools, using emotional and vocal recognition to support users.
